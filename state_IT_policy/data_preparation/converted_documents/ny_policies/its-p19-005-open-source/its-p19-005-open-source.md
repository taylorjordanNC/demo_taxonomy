## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This policy describes the acceptable use of Open-source software (OSS). The purpose is to maximize the impact and benefit of using OSS and to ensure that any technical, legal, or business risks resulting from that usage are properly mitigated. OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. Unlike other software, OSS makes its source code freely available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 charges the State Chief Information Officer with Technology Services (ITS) . Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in New York State (NYS) ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .
