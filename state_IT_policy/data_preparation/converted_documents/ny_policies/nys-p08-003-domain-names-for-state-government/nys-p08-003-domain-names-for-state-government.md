## New York State Information Technology Policy

IT Policy :

## Domain Names for State Government Agencies

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The purpose of this Information Technology Policy is to provide information regarding the use of domain names by state government entities for public facing and intranet websites. This policy assures the assigned domain names appropriately reflect New York State government services and major programs. The use of the "ny.gov" domain provides for branding New York State government services available on the Internet and enables customers to readily recognize official New York State government entity websites.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy , NYSP08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines.

ITS has secured the domain "ny.gov" for New York State government entity use.

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## 4.0 Information Statement

All SE websites will use a standard domain naming convention which is determined and enforced by ITS.

## 4.1 Domain Naming Convention

All domain names must:

- · Be easily understood and recognizable by the residents of New York State Clearly communicate the purpose of the site;
- · Be easy to type and avoid using confusing characters such as zeroes (0) in place of the letter "O" or the number one (1) in place of the letter "L" (l).
- · Contain no less than 10 but no more than 36 characters, including the ny.gov portion of the domain name (the "dots" are considered characters - hence subdomains of ny.gov are to have at least 3 characters)
- · Contain letters, numbers and dashes (-), but no other special characters such as underscores (\_) and blank spaces;
- · Avoid the use of acronyms whenever possible, unless the acronym meets one of the following conditions:
- a) The SE is commonly known by the acronym, or
- b) The acronym represents a commonly known major program. Major programs may be multiple or single agency programs but widely known to the general public. This program naming option is not intended for small, targeted audience programs. Web pages for such smaller programs must be part of the SE's main domain name pages (e.g., www.health.ny.gov/flu);
- · Refrain from using general terms such as "licenses," "recreation," and "benefits" without an identifier because they do not represent a specific agency/program origin or service. For example, "DriversLicenses.ny.gov" may be allowed. Statewide services that would be best represented by a general term would be an infrequent exception to this rule (e.g., desktop.ny.gov, login.ny.gov).
- · Use short URLs over a separate or sub-domain address, for areas on the same website (e.g., use health.ny.gov/flu instead of flu.health.ny.gov).

## 4.2 Naming Patterns

## 4.2.1 Naming Patterns Within ny.gov Domain:

Within the ny.gov domain, the allowed naming patterns are:

"nys\_entity\_name".ny.gov or

"program\_name".ny.gov or

"application\_name"."agency\_name".ny.gov

"program\_name"."agency\_name".ny.gov

"nys\_entity\_name".ny.gov/"program\_name" or

"Microsoft\_AD\_domain".ny.gov

## 4.3 General Domain Requirements

In addition to the naming conventions, the following restrictions apply:

## 4.3.1 No Non-Government Advertisements

A dot-gov domain and the ny.gov sub-domain, may not be used to advertise for private individuals, firms, corporations, or imply in any way the federal or state government endorses or favors any specific commercial product, commodity, or service.

## 4.3.2 No Political or Campaign Information

The dot-gov domain, and the ny.gov sub-domain, is for the sole operation of government, not for use in any political, political party, or campaign environment. No campaigning can be conducted with dot-gov domains. No dot-gov website may link, directly or indirectly, or refer to websites created or operated by a campaign or any campaign entity or political or campaign committee. Political sites, party names, or party acronyms cannot be used.

## 4.3.3 Two-Year Eligibility Period

All dot-gov domains are registered for a 2-year period. During this period, a review of eligibility and administrative information is required. If necessary, the dot-gov Registrar will contact the Administrative Point of Contact (APOC) for domains. APOC information MUST be kept current. The dot-gov Registrar may request an updated authorization letter, updated Domain Name Server (DNS) information, or other information. This information enables the federal government to ensure dot-gov domains provide secure, official websites and promote the best possible service to the general public.

## 4.4 Procedure to Request a Domain Name

SEs must obtain ITS approval before requesting any new third level domains (i.e., "agency\_name".ny.gov or "program\_name".ny.gov) using the form at https://on.ny.gov/domain-exception-request. ITS will review and respond to all requests within five (5) business days.

Once a domain has been determined and approved, the appropriate ITS Customer Relations Manager can submit a Service Request ticket to initiate the work required for set up in the ITSM service catalog: Network Services > DNS Entry.

## 4.5 Use of Approved Domains.

SEs should use only ny.gov domains. It is highly discouraged to use any other top-level domain unless the head of the SE explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an SE function. The use of any other domain runs the risk of the domain being lost or acquired by another entity. The ny.gov address ensures the public that it is an official state site and can be trusted.

This requirement recognizes the proper performance of SE functions and includes an obligation for clear and unambiguous public notification of the SE's involvement in, or sponsorship of its information dissemination products including public websites. It also recognizes in certain limited circumstances other domains may be necessary for the proper performance of an SE function.

## 4.6 Link Change Notification

When a link on a ny.gov Internet domain makes causes the user to leave a ny.gov Internet website, a notification or screen (i.e., a splash message) should alert users that they are leaving the official ny.gov Internet domain page. When a link on a ny.gov domain makes the user go to another ny.gov domain, a notification or screen (i.e., a splash message) should not alert users that they are leaving the official ny.gov Internet domain page because the user is still within the ny.gov domain. (e.g., governor.ny.gov linking to its.ny.gov)

## 4.7 New York State Government Entity Compliance

Effective immediately, all new requests for state government entity Internet websites, and requests for domain names shall use domain names as described within this policy.

The following is required by all state government entities to be in compliance:

- · Use of a ny.gov domain name for the state government entity's main public web site;
- · State government entities must retire their legacy domain names immediately.
- · Use of either ny.gov or the ITS approved ny.gov domain name for the primary website name must be provided on all documents, publications, correspondence, and public service information for the state government entity.

## 4.8 Federal Government Compliance

The Federal Government can terminate or deny the use of an organization's dot-gov domain name where such websites are not operated in compliance with the conditions of use.

## 5.0 Compliance

This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

If compliance with this policy is not feasible or technically possible, or if a deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, SEs shall request an exception through the Chief Technology Office exception process.

## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms

Except for terms defined in this policy, all terms shall have the meanings found in http:/its.ny.gov/glossary.
