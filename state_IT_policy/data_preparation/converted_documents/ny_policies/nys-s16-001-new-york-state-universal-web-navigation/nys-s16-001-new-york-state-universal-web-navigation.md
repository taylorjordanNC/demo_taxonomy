No:

NYS-S16-001

Updated:

10/12/2023

Issued By: NYS Office of Information Technology Services (ITS)

Chief Technology Office /

Owner: WebNY

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The purpose of this mandatory technology standard is to define a Universal Navigation to be used for all New York State government entities' public web sites and web applications.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services ("ITS") with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## 4.0 Information Statement

The New York State Universal Navigation connects all NYS web sites to www.ny.gov both visually and interactively, enabling users to navigate government services from anywhere across the "NYS Web."

The Universal Navigation consists of header and footer navigation menus for use on SE public web sites. The Universal Navigation elements are to be placed on all SE public web sites and web applications as defined below.

## 4.1 New York State Universal Navigation

The official embeddable code of the Universal Navigation and implementation instructions are found on the New York State GitHub account in the "Universal Navigation" repository.

To accommodate web sites with requirements that limit the standard functionality of the Universal Navigation, multiple versions may be included in the repository. Be sure to use the appropriate version for your site or application, following the instructions specific to that version. Guidelines or instructions included in the repository should be considered an extension of this standard.

To aid in implementation, the repository also contains guidance, frequently asked questions, demo versions, and other resources.

## 4.2 Universal Navigation Size

The Universal Navigation is designed to extend the entire width of the webpage. Unless a specific exclusion is made based on a written request, the Universal Navigation should extend to the full width, with no space between the respective elements and the corresponding edges of the browser or application window. The elements use responsive design techniques to appropriately scale for different devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones (provided the site or application was also designed in a responsive manner).

## 4.3 Universal Navigation Color

The Universal Navigation is designed to blend with NYS sites and applications; hence colors of the Universal Navigation are not to be adjusted. Colors on existing web sites should continue to follow the established NYS Branding Guidelines.

## 4.4 Placement of the Universal Navigation

The Universal Navigation must appear at the top of every page on the SE's public web sites and web applications. Nothing should appear above the Universal Navigation in the browser or application window except NYS translation functionality. No additional edits should be made to alter the appearance of the Universal Navigation, including additional links. No elements of the native web page or application should overlap the container element of the Universal Navigation.

## 4.5 Intranet and Non-Public Facing Sites or Applications

If inclusion enhances the user experience, Intranet web sites, extranets, and other nonpublic facing sites or applications may include the Universal Navigation but are not required to do so.

## 4.6 Functionality and Updates to the Universal Navigation

Functionality of the Universal Navigation should be tested in a development environment before deploying. If problems exist when implementing the standard version, check in the repository for additional authorized versions that can be used until problems are resolved.

Updates to the Universal Navigation occur periodically. In general, a testing period will precede official deployment of updates. Test the updates in development environments and submit problems or concerns through the ITS Enterprise Information Technology Management System's ("ITSM") WebNY Enterprise Platform Services Bureau assignment group, L2 PLAT WEBNY SUPPORT.

## 4.7 Including Accessibility Features

The Universal Navigation is designed to work with various accessibility requirements. A "skip to content" or "skip to navigation" link is commonly used at the top of a webpage as a way to accommodate visitors utilizing screen readers or with limited motor abilities. When possible, a "skip to content" link should:

- 1. Remain hidden from normal view until engaged with no space between the Universal Navigation header element and the top of the web page or application.
- 2. Act as the initial link for screen readers.
- 3. Appear when common accessibility practices are engaged.

## 5.0 Compliance

This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this standard is necessary to support a business function, SEs shall request an exception through the WebNY Enterprise Platform Services exception process.

ITS may also assess SE compliance with this standard. To accomplish this assessment, ITS may issue, from time to time, requests for information to SEs, which will be used to develop any reporting requirements as may be requested by the NYS Chief Information Officer, the Executive Chamber, or Legislative entities.

## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms

Except for terms defined in this policy, all terms shall have the meanings found in https://its.ny.gov/glossary.
