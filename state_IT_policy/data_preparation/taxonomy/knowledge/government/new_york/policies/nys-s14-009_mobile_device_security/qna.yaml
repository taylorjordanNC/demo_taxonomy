      ## 4.0 Information Statement

      All SE websites will use a standard domain naming convention which is determined and enforced by ITS.

      All domain names must:
      - · Be easily understood and recognizable by the residents of New York State Clearly communicate the purpose of the site;
      - · Be easy to type and avoid using confusing characters such as zeroes (0) in place of the letter "O" or the number one (1) in place of the letter "L" (l).
      - · Contain no less than 10 but no more than 36 characters, including the ny.gov portion of the domain name (the "dots" are considered characters - hence subdomains of ny.gov are to have at least 3 characters)
      - · Contain letters, numbers and dashes (-), but no other special characters such as underscores (\_) and blank spaces;
      - · Avoid the use of acronyms whenever possible, unless the acronym meets one of the following conditions:
      - a) The SE is commonly known by the acronym, or
      - b) The acronym represents a commonly known major program. Major programs may be multiple or single agency programs but widely known to the general public. This program naming option is not intended for small, targeted audience programs. Web pages for such smaller programs must be part of the SE's main domain name pages (e.g., www.health.ny.gov/flu);
      - · Refrain from using general terms such as "licenses," "recreation," and "benefits" without an identifier because they do not represent a specific agency/program origin or service. For example, "DriversLicenses.ny.gov" may be allowed. Statewide services that would be best represented by a general term would be an infrequent exception to this rule (e.g., desktop.ny.gov, login.ny.gov).
      - · Use short URLs over a separate or sub-domain address, for areas on the same website (e.g., use health.ny.gov/flu instead of flu.health.ny.gov).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Should SE websites have sub-domain addresses?
        answer: |
          SE websites should use short URLs over a separate or sub-domain address or areas on the same website. An example of this is health.ny.gov/flu instead of flu.health.ny.gov.
      - question: |
          When should SE domain names use acronyms?
        answer: |
          SE websites should avoid the use of acronyms unless the SE is commonly known by the acronym or the acronym represents a commonly known major program.
      - question: |
          Can SE domain names contail special characters?
        answer: |
          No, SE domain names cannot contain special characters such as underscores and blank spaces. They can only contain letters, numbers, and dashes.

      It is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business
      unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to
      the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM,
      or a CS-201 Form must be completed.

      E-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not
      limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers,

      guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.
      Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA
      Service Request.

      As established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision
      policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment,
      no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before
      turning over equipment to ITS.

      In accordance with Section 168 of the SFL, prior to surplus or disposal of E-equipment, consideration
      should be given to donating to the Computer Recycling for Education and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) program.
      This program was created to take computer equipment that is no longer needed by the state and private industry
      and distribute to schools, libraries, and other educational institutions.
