  - context: |
      The client has the right to cancel parts of the assignment that have not been completed. In the event of cancellation, the consultant
      is entitled to compensation for work performed, costs incurred and reasonable costs for liquidation that are not compensated in any other way.
      The consultant is not entitled to compensation for loss of profit in the event of cancellation of assignments. If the cancellation is due
      to a decision by the authorities over which the client could not have controlled, the consultant is entitled to compensation for work performed,
      costs incurred and reasonable costs for discontinuation that are not reimbursed in any other way. The same applies if the conditions for
      the completion of the assignment, beyond the client's control, have changed to a significant extent and it is not reasonable to complete
      the assignment in view of this. Regardless of whether cancellation and/or cancellation takes place, the client is entitled to compensation
      for the direct damage caused by the defect. In the event of cancellation, the result of the work performed must be reported and handed over
      to the client no later than when the client has fulfilled its payment obligation. After handover, the results of the assignment may be used
      in the same way as if the assignment had been completed. If the client wishes to claim that the assignment has been carried out incorrectly,
      the client must notify the consultant within a reasonable time from the time the error is established. In cases where an investigation of
      suspicion that one or more of the circumstances listed above exist, the client has the right to temporarily remove the availability
      (so-called local temporary order suspension) for the consultant's framework agreement. The disputed circumstance that led to the order
      freeze does not require that a dispute has been finally settled. Throughout the time the disputed issue is subject to investigation and
      consideration, the client thus has the opportunity to use a local temporary order freeze. The consultant is not entitled to compensation
      for loss of income or other costs due to temporary order suspension. In the event of early termination, the consultant is entitled to
      reasonable remuneration for the services provided by the consultant up to the date of termination of the framework agreement, but no right
      to receive any other remuneration due to the termination of the framework agreement.

          or discontinuation that are not compensated in any other way.

          was established.

      Prepared documents, such as reports, analyses, investigations, procurement documents, construction documents and the like,
      must be reviewed and approved by the project manager or a person with equivalent responsibility before delivery.

      This approval must be reported by the specialist's signing, manually or digitally, of the prepared material, as well as
      dating when the approval was made.  The approval signature can be submitted on a separate document, which must then contain a
      list of the documents to which the approval relates. If the document has been prepared by a specialist, the examination must be
      carried out by another specialist. If the consulting company has only offered one specialist, a special agreement must be made
      with the client at the time of ordering regarding how this quality control is to be carried out.

      The consultant's quality plan must report on how specialist review is to take place. If an approval signature of a specialist
      is missing when documents are delivered, these may be sent back to the consultant without further processing by the client
      until such approval is handed over from the consultant.

      In the event of a failure to provide an approval signature upon delivery, the client has the right to withhold payment for
      the work to which the delivery relates until such signature is submitted.
