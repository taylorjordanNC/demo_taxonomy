## 2. CONSULT IT DATA

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The purpose of the framework agreement procurement is to secure the authorities' need for IT consulting services with a wide range of suppliers who have expertise in the following competence/sub-area. For all sub-areas, call-offs apply to both assignments and resources.

- - Consultant broker, brokerage of the service approx. 45%.
- - System development and system administration approx. 11%
- - Management and governance / Business development and strategy approx. 18%
- - Infrastructure and communication about 10%
- - Information security approx. 4%
- - GIS, Geographic Information Systems approx. 3%
- - Technical support - Service desk approx. 2%
- - Web development approx. 2.5%
- - Architects approx. 3%
- - Test and test management approx. 2%.

<!-- image -->

Call-offs for strategic and/or more advanced solutions (e.g. servers, storage, communications), product-specific services in narrow areas may be subject to their own procurement or already existing framework agreements, e.g. data centres.

When the need for specialist expertise (in addition to those specified) arises, this will primarily be procured via the Consultant Broker area.

#### 2.1.2. Number of suppliers

The procurement is concluded by Purchasing and Procurement signing a framework agreement with a supplier in subarea A - Consultant Brokers.

Other sub-areas - The procurement is concluded by Purchasing and Procurement and the accepted suppliers signing a framework agreement. The intention is that framework agreements will be signed with several suppliers in all areas.

The number of suppliers with which framework agreements will be signed depends on the number of tenders received and that the accepted suppliers have a capacity that corresponds to the needs of the contract users, which is why framework agreements may be signed with both fewer and more than 5 suppliers per sub-area.

For sub-area G - Technical Support and Service Desk and J - Test and Test Management, the goal is to accept fewer Suppliers than in the other sub-areas.

#### 2.1.3. Split tenders

The supplier can choose to submit tenders for all sub-areas or only separate sub-areas.

##### Limitation on assignment

A Supplier may be awarded in a maximum of three sub-areas of the procurement. A Supplier may be awarded for more than three sub-areas only in the event that there are not enough qualified tenders in the other sub-areas. The supplier shall rank its tenders by sub-area in Appendix 4 Capacity, sheet Ranking of tenders.

For each sub-area B-J, if there are enough qualified tenders, it must be possible to accept a maximum of 1 tender for the suppliers who have consultancy brokerage as their main activity.

Clients within the following are entitled to order from the Framework Agreement:

- City of Gothenburg
- The Association of Local Authorities in the Gothenburg Region and ISGR AB
- Greater Gothenburg Fire and Rescue Service
- Gryning Vård AB
- The Gothenburg Nursing Home Foundation, including foundations and companies
- Härryda municipality
- Kungälv Municipality
- Lerum Municipality and Lerum Energi

Each Client is responsible for its use of and orders from the Framework Agreement.

If a Client transfers a business to another legal entity and the need for orders from the Framework Agreement is taken over, the Client also has the right to order under the Framework Agreement.

Activities that affect the agreement area can be conducted under our own management. In such cases, the Framework Agreement is to be regarded as a complement to the company's own activities.

In cases where there are agreements already in force and agreements that have arisen during the contract period for the activities that concern the area of the Framework Agreement, these do not cease to apply in connection with this Framework Agreement.

<!-- image -->

##### Estimated business value

The order volume for all sub-areas during the total contract period is estimated at SEK 1200000000. The specified volume represents the business value of the Framework Agreement. This is only an estimate based on the turnover of previous Framework Agreements, expected quantities for the Clients and what has emerged in the analysis prior to the procurement. The actual outcome can be both higher (but maximum the ceiling volume of the procurement) and lower, and no guaranteed volumes are provided.

The distribution of business value as stated under item scope shows that the largest sub-areas are:

• Subarea A - Consultant broker approx. 45% • And subarea (B, C and D) approx. 35 - 40%.

##### Ceiling volume

However, the total order volume for all sub-areas/per sub-area during the total contract period may not exceed SEK 1,400,000,000. The specified volume constitutes the ceiling volume of the Framework Agreement.

In the event of a change in operations/organisation, changed legislation, political decisions, official decisions or the like that affect the need, volumes, number of Clients or delivery points, Purchasing and Procurement reserves the right to adjust the above-mentioned ceiling volume for the Framework Agreement in accordance with the conditions set out below.

If the Framework Agreement's turnover reaches the specified ceiling volume or this situation is expected to occur in the near future, Purchasing and Procurement has the right to terminate the Framework Agreement with immediate effect. Such termination shall not affect the validity of contracts concluded on the basis of the Framework Agreement prior to that date.

##### Amendment option ceiling volume

If the accumulated value of call-offs made from the Framework Agreement during the first 24 months of the agreement period exceeds more than 60 per cent of the value of the specified ceiling volume, Purchasing and Procurement is entitled to increase the specified ceiling volume by 20 per cent. In this respect, value refers to the amounts in SEK that constitute the total call-offs from the ceiling volume of the Framework Agreement.

The change option can be exercised during the entire planned contract period. In the event that Purchasing and Procurement exercises the option, written notice shall be sent to the Supplier.

#### 2.1.6 Procurement timetable

The tender must be received Purchasing and procurement by: 2022-05-23 23:59

The last day to ask questions is nine days before the last day of tender, and answers are announced no later than six days before the last day of tender.

The Supplier must have paid its taxes and social security contributions and be registered in a limited liability company, commercial or equivalent register, which is kept in the country for the purpose of the Supplier's business. The supplier must also be registered for VAT (excluding tax-free activities) and hold an F-tax certificate.

Purchasing and Procurement collects information from the relevant authorities to check that the Supplier meets statutory requirements regarding its payments of taxes and social security contributions and registration. The requirement must be fulfilled on the date on which the data is collected. In the event that it is not possible for Purchasing and Procurement to gain access to the information in question, the Supplier shall, at the request of Purchasing and Procurement, disclose this information.

The foreign Supplier must be able to provide proof in English that proves that the company does not have outstanding debts relating to taxes and social security contributions in its own country. This must be substantiated with the corresponding information as appears in the Swedish Tax Agency's form SKV 4820. Proof that the business is conducted in accordance with the country's rules on the register of limited liability companies, commercial registers or similar registers must also be provided.

<!-- image -->

The supplier must have such financial stability and financial position that the framework agreement can be implemented without the risk of disruption due to financial problems. Purchasing and Procurement collects and assesses the Supplier's creditworthiness with the help of the business and credit information company Creditsafe. The supplier must have a risk class/rating corresponding to at least "medium risk."

##### Alternative accounting

If the Supplier has a lower risk class/rating or for some other reason cannot obtain a rating, the Supplier may still be considered to meet this requirement by reporting its financial position in another way and proving that it has sufficient financial position to fulfil the Assignment during the term of the agreement.

Evidence may consist of the latest income statement, parent company guarantee or other guarantor, auditor's certificate, or other financial statement showing that the creditworthiness requirement is met.

<!-- image -->

The supplier must have a quality management system in accordance with ISO 9001, FR 2000, Swedish Quality Base or equivalent, or its own quality management system that guarantees the same quality of services and products.

A quality management system of its own shall contain at least the following:

- An introduced quality policy
- Routine for continuous competence development of staff
- Procedure for registration of regulatory requirements, decisions and regulations relating to the business
- Procedure for how subcontractors are quality assured
- Procedure for registration and management of deviations and improvements • Annual internal and/or external audit of the quality management system.

The quality management system must be documented and proof that the requirement for a quality management system is met must be attached to the tender and may consist of:

- Copy of the applicable certificate or
- An account of all the points that a separate quality management system should contain.

<!-- image -->

The supplier and any external capacity/subcontractors must have the necessary technical ability and capacity for the implementation of the assignment, taking into account the minimum number of suppliers that may be accepted, and be organised so that the business is conducted with a high level of service and good quality.

<!-- image -->

As proof of technical ability and capacity, a brief description of the Supplier (and any subcontractors) regarding the company's operations, business concept and the number of employees (consulting resources and also administrative staff) must be submitted in accordance with the points below. Qualification requirements for capacity apply in the first instance, in addition to this description, according to the report per each sub-area Appendix 4 Capacity and Appendix 6 List of consultants.

Appendix 4 and Appendix 6 do not apply to subarea A - Consultant brokers.

Thus, a supplier who submits tenders for more than one sub-area can be deemed to meet the requirement for one sub-area but not for another.

CVs for quoted consultants should not be attached to the tender, but these, as well as other evidence, may be requested by Purchasing and Procurement during the evaluation process and then it must be possible to provide it electronically no later than 2 weeks after the request.

*NB! Appendix 4 capacity per sub-area specifies the capacity required for capacity requirements to be met. The supplier will not receive "extra points" for greater capacity than required. However, and when the Supplier has more capacity than required, this capacity can also be specified. This may be of importance when evaluating tenders a certain of the Supplier's capacities in the tender is not approved.

Appendix 6 - If a consultant is reused for two roles within the same sub-area, the consultant's name must then be filled in on one line.

<!-- image -->

###### Applies to all references appendices

- Reference assignments must be specified in accordance with the information requested in all Appendices in the procurement referred to as References and as stated below.
- Each reference must together prove the experience requirement. If a subcontractor is used, it is the supplier's and subcontractor's combined reference assignment that must prove the requirements. Purchasing and Procurement reserves the right to assess whether the specified reference assignment supports the experience requirement or not.
- It is permitted to cite the City of Gothenburg as a reference.
- Reference assignments within your own organization are not accepted.

###### Appendix 2 References Supplier

Reference assignments must prove that the supplier has experience of assignments equivalent to those that may be ordered from the framework agreement. All the information in the completed Appendix, i.e. also the answers of the Judges, must be attached to the tender at the end of the tender period.

Two references about the Supplier on similar assignments and scope carried out during the last 3 years via a framework agreement or contractual relationship with the client (assignments/projects on a larger scale and period of 2 years are also accepted). The assignment does not need to be both started and completed within the last 3 years to be approved.

"A call-off from similar framework agreements of, for example, 20 hours does not count as similar assignments!"

The requirement of only two references applies regardless of whether tenders are submitted for one sub-area (procurement) or several (applies to sub-areas B-J) and is intended for the assessment of the Supplier/external capacity. A fallback reference No 3 may be submitted.

"The above means that a Supplier (Tenderer) can submit tenders for e.g. 4 (B-J) different sub-areas but specify 2 References that apply to only 2 sub-areas and still meet the requirement above, i.e. qualify for all 4 sub-areas"

The supplier is responsible for ensuring that the contact person for the assignment is spoken to and can be reached by e-mail/phone number. The contact person (referee) may be contacted during the evaluation period and must have knowledge of how the assignment has been carried out in its operations, must be able to confirm that the assignment has been carried out as stated in the description and that the information has been filled in by this referee himself, even if these are submitted by the Supplier.

The reference assignments must relate to different clients (companies, authorities, companies). Ongoing reference assignments may also be approved if other conditions are met.

When the Supplier also submits tenders for sub-area A - Consultant Broker, 2 additional references must be provided, and then according to Appendix 2 B References Consultant Broker. These two references are evaluated.

###### Appendix 2A References Consultancy competence (applies to sub-areas B - J)

- The information to be filled in by the Supplier, as set out in the Appendix, shall be attached to the tender at the end of the tender period in this Appendix.
- The information and grades in the same appendix that must be filled in by the specified contact person (the referee) may not be filled in by the Supplier and must not be sent with the tender.
- Please note that in some cases, references refer to a resource (specified competence role and skill level) and in other cases to a so-called project assignment.
- The appendix may not be divided by sub-area, but must be submitted as a single Appendix (one file) regardless of how many sub-areas tenders are submitted.
- One and the same referee may be reused a maximum of three times, but not within the same sub-area of the procurement.
- After submitting tenders, Purchasing and Procurement will send the same Appendix to the specified referees. The answers must be filled in by the specified referees and emailed to Purchasing and Procurement.
- Referees who do not respond within the specified time will receive a reminder and an extra week to submit a response. A copy of the reminder may be sent to the Supplier. In the event of a lack of response from the referee, the Supplier receives zero points in the evaluation.
- What otherwise applies is stated under item Reference per all sub-areas B - J.

###### Appendix 2 B References Consultant Brokers

Terms and conditions are stated under documents Consultant Broker and item Reference Delivery.

<!-- image -->

A Supplier that does not itself meet the requirements set out under "Requirements of economic and financial standing", "Technical and professional capacity" and/or has the possibility of relying on other or other companies' capacities to meet the requirements. In such cases, the supplier must be able to use the resources of these companies to the extent necessary to meet the requirements.

In the event that the Supplier refers to the capacity of other companies to meet the requirements, these companies must be reported below with the organisation name and organisation number.

###### ESPD for Claimed Capacity

If the Supplier chooses to use the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) for itself and the capacity of other companies is invoked as above, a completed ESPD for each such company must also be submitted. In order for the Supplier to technically be able to submit an ESPD for such a company, the Supplier is required to register the company in question under TendSign's process step "Subcontractors" and select the option "Invoke capacity" for the company when registering. In the event that the Supplier does not use the ESPD for its own part and/or no other company's capacity is invoked, the Supplier can completely ignore TendSign's process step "Subcontractors".

NB! To eliminate questions about the use of ESPDs, we clarify this further. - Submitting an ESPD is always voluntary and never a requirement. ESPD does not need  and should preferably not be used in this procurement.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A supplier who plans to carry out all or part of the assignment with the help of a subcontractor must report these in Appendix 4 capacity, tab Subcontractors and attach the appendix to the tender.

<!-- image -->

The purpose of the requirements below is to limit the reuse of the same subcontractors and consultants unlimitedly.

<!-- image -->

The supplier who has submitted tenders, in one or more sub-areas, shall not be  able to participate as a subcontractor with another tenderer with the same consulting capacity/consultants regardless of sub-area regardless of sub-area if one of them has the capacity to submit tenders themselves. However, this does not apply to the sub-area Consultant Broker.

A Supplier who has submitted a tender for one or more sub-areas of the procurement may also participate as a subcontractor in another Supplier's tender and another sub-area, but only with consulting capacity that is not used in its own tender.

It is up to the Provider to check this. A subcontractor's total consulting capacity may be invoked by a maximum of 2 different suppliers regardless of sub-areas. A subcontractor may also participate in more than two tenders, but then only with completely different consulting capacity.

If a Supplier is awarded in the procurement and Purchasing and Procurement discovers during the framework agreement period that the requirement set out above has not been met, Purchasing and Procurement shall have the right to terminate the framework agreement with the supplier.

<!-- image -->

When reporting delivery capacity, only consultants, employees of the Supplier or subcontractors at one stage shall  be reported. It is also not permitted to use resources in two stages during the contract period, i.e. a subcontractor may not have its own subcontractor.

<!-- image -->

The supplier gets a maximum of two times. Offer one and the same consultant as capacity (either via two roles within the same area of expertise or in two different sub-areas) but only on the condition that the 25% rule on reuse is met. A consultant may be quoted a maximum of two times, regardless of whether tenders are submitted for only one or more sub-areas B-J. The same also applies to the subcontractor's consulting capacity that may be included in the tender.

<!-- image -->

The possibility of reusing the consultant(s) must be possible to a maximum of 25% of the total quoted capacity. For example, if the total capacity requirement for a sub-area is at least 20 consultants and the supplier offers exactly that capacity, then it may be done with at least 15 consultants. I.e. 5 consultants could be reused in a different role within the same sub-area. In the event that one or more subcontractors' consulting capacity is included in a tender, the 25% rule shall apply according to "Supplier + All Subcontractors", i.e. to the entire tender.

Please note that the requirement of a maximum of 25% reuse of consultants applies in total to all sub-areas for which tenders are submitted. If the supplier submits tenders for three different sub-areas where t.

e.g. the total consulting capacity required is a minimum of 50 consultants (e.g. area 1 =20; area 2 =10; area 3 =20), then the supplier has the right to reuse 12 consultants in total (where 12 is 25% of 50).

If and when a consultant is reused as a capacity, fill in Appendix 6 Consultant List.

<!-- image -->

In the event that subcontractors are included in the tender, the supplier's response must relate to the whole, i.e. including all subcontractors.

If Purchasing and Procurement discovers that a subcontractor participates in more than two tenders with the same consulting capacity or does not meet the qualification requirements, this subcontractor will be removed from all tenders. Purchasing and Procurement reserves the right not to give the supplier the opportunity to supplement tenders with another subcontractor unless this has been invoked as an external capacity.

The supplier's offer may still be accepted, even after the subcontractor's exclusion, if the requirements for consultancy capacity and other requirements are still met.

<!-- image -->

Chapter 13. Sections 1 and 2 of the Public Procurement Act specify grounds for exclusion that are binding, while Chapter 13. Section 3 of the Public Procurement Act specifies the grounds that make it possible for Purchasing and Procurement to exclude a Supplier from participation in the procurement. The grounds for exclusion apply even if representatives of the Supplier are guilty of the violations.

If a company whose capacity is invoked is guilty of an offence pursuant to Chapter 13, Sections 1 – 3, Purchasing and Procurement will request that this company be replaced. In the event that the company is not replaced, the company will be excluded from the Supplier's tender, which may have consequences for the entire tender.

The City of Gothenburg and Purchasing and Procurement work actively to ensure that rogue Suppliers do not appear in the City's Framework Agreement. The work includes continuous follow-up and testing of the Suppliers' seriousness. Purchasing and procurement are part of a cooperation between the authorities where one of the goals of the cooperation is to identify irregularities in connection with procurements.

##### Declaration pursuant to Chapter 15. 9 § LOU

The supplier must below ensure that there are no grounds for exclusion pursuant to Chapter 13. Section 1 of the Public Procurement Act (organised crime, corruption, fraud, terrorist offences and offences related to terrorist activities, money laundering and terrorist financing, human trafficking). The declaration submitted shall cover both the Supplier and persons who, at the time of submission of the tender, are members of administrative, management or control bodies of the Supplier or persons authorised to represent, make decisions about or control the Supplier.

If the Supplier is unable to provide assurance in accordance with the above, an explanation for this must be provided in the free text field/comment in the question below.

<!-- image -->

For all sub-areas, the requirements for a number of consultants, roles and competence levels are stated in Appendix 4, sheet Supplier + Subcontractors. Whether the requirement is met or not will be clear after the Supplier has completed the attached appendix.

In some areas, there is no requirement that all consultant roles and skill levels must be quoted. Note that the formula in Appendix 4 capacity does not take into account that consultant roles that are subject to reference are quoted (roles marked with a yellow background in the appendix). Offering these roles at the levels listed in Annex 2A References Consulting Skills is not a mandatory requirement, but the provider will be awarded zero points in the evaluation of these roles.

Other requirements apply according to the attached appendices and document parts per each sub-area.

<!-- image -->

The aim is to offer an overall model for competence classification, primarily to be used in procurement but also as a starting point when ordering or calling off consultancy services, however, where roles and services can be further specified, added or removed during the framework agreement period. The competence classification should be used in the evaluation of competencies and competence levels, the pricing of consulting services and also in the follow-up of the performance of consulting services.

All areas of expertise (so-called sub-areas) in this framework agreement are related to IT, directly or indirectly.

In the procurement, the relevant sub-area is crucial and comprehensive. This means that, for example, in the case of call-offs that concern assignments, or when several roles are to collaborate within a certain project and most of the roles are within a certain sub-area, the choice of sub-area must have a decisive role, or in the case of call-offs of competence/roles that are not defined within a certain sub-area.

If a call-off for a resource/competence role is made and the role is defined/described in any sub-area, then the sub-area where the role is described must be selected for call-off of the role.

<!-- image -->

All sub-areas refer to suppliers who must have the capacity to deliver both consultants as a resource and also consultancy services as assignments (project assignments) with broad and tangible delivery capacity.

Contract consultancy services (project assignments) mean that the supplier takes the main responsibility for the results of a specific assignment, which includes the supplier and any other personnel appointed by the authority. Contract consulting services are designed so that a fixed price/scope of the assignment is agreed to achieve a specific result or goal. These services are carried out under the supplier's management with a requirement specification as a basis and part/final delivery as delivery control.

Resource consulting services mean that the consultancy service strengthens the authority in work that is run by the authority. The consultant's role can either be to provide expert expertise that the authority does not have access to, or that the consultant is a mere resource reinforcement. These services are performed under the direction of the authority, i.e. the authority is responsible for the supervision of the Supplier's personnel, such as for its own.

Subarea A, Consultant Broker, refers to suppliers who can deliver consulting services with special expertise in several areas of expertise, both those named (B-J) but also others. The consultant brokerage company's main activity shall be the mediation of services where no ownership relationship exists between the supplier and subcontractors. Consultant brokers shall be responsible for the business relationship in its entirety vis-à-vis the client.

<!-- image -->

The level descriptions are on an overall level. When classifying a consultant's competence in the relevant area of expertise, the level of competence that best suits the applicant must be chosen. Experience in number of years means the total number of years worked in the role. The consultant must have worked most of the time in the role in question during the number of total years worked.

A consultant who is considered to have reached a level after a shorter period of time than what is stated as normal for the level is not automatically excluded. However, in order to be accepted, the Framework Agreement Supplier must prove that the Consultant possesses sufficient competence in the role in question to achieve the level despite the fact that the Consultant has worked for a shorter period of time than what is stated as normal to achieve the level. This aims to facilitate the provision of a consultant who is particularly competent in relation to the hours worked in the current role. The burden of proof for this lies with the Framework Agreement Provider, and in such cases it is always up to the

Call-off entitled to make an assessment of whether the consultant's competence with sufficient certainty can be considered sufficient.

<!-- image -->

Level 6 is an exception to the maximum prices according to tenders. The maximum permitted price for the framework agreement in each sub-area shall be based on competence level 5.

Level 6 shall be applicable during the contract period only when it has proven to be impossible to obtain the required competence according to level 5 via call-offs, regardless of the competence role.

Level 6 may be quoted when it has been requested and approved by the Client. The price at this level is also limited to a maximum of 2000 SEK.

In a call-off of level 5 via FKU, call-offs should be able to give the opportunity to framework agreement suppliers to offer level 6 competence, but only on the condition that the framework agreement supplier cannot offer level 5 competence. In the event that no qualified bids at level 5 have been quoted, callers must be able to evaluate and accept bids of level 6 competence.

###### Level 6 Exemption - For each call-off where a higher price than the set price

<!-- image -->

Yes/No. Yes required

#### 2.3.4 Certifications

The supplier should specify all relevant certifications per consultant (consultant role) per each sub-area and in accordance with Appendix 6. The level of certification should also be stated or, in some cases, to which product the certification is linked.

Please note that certifications are not a requirement in the procurement and when submitting tenders, but are stated for information purposes. However, the Client shall be able to set the requirement for specified certifications when call-off during the framework agreement period.

### 2.4 Evaluation

#### 2.4.1. Grounds for evaluation

Economically most advantageous based on the best price-quality ratio. The criteria are specified per each sub-area.

If, after evaluation, tenders cannot be distinguished, a draw will be carried out to finally distinguish the tenders. Drawing will be conducted by Purchasing and Procurement with three people present to ensure the impartiality of the procedure.

#### 2.4.2. Award criteria

The award criteria describe each sub-area B-J and are:

- Price
- References.

The award criteria for subarea A - Consultant Broker are

- Price
- Margin percentage
- Several quality criteria that are specifically stated in document A - Consultant Broker.

#### 2.4.3. Description of the evaluation model

A description of the evaluation model (linear scale) used is attached as an appendix. Please note that the appendix is a general model description and is not adapted to the exact evaluation criteria used in this procurement per each sub-area.

##### Description of how the model will be used in this procurement

NB! In addition to what is stated below, there are more specific descriptions under each sub-area what applies to the various evaluation criteria.

##### The evaluation criterion Price sub-area A and B-J

All prices must be given without decimals. Prices that are calculated up and down for other competence levels are also rounded without decimals. However, the number of points awarded for a certain tender amount can be to two decimal places.

The supplier shall in Appendix 1 Prices, for each sub-area (A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J) only state the price per hour for competence level 4 and for sub-area G - Technical support and Service Desk, the price per hour for competence level 3 shall be stated.

Based on the submitted tender price, the price for higher and lower level of competence is calculated as described in documents for each sub-area (Higher and lower level prices are also stated in "Appendix 1 Prices" after the Supplier has submitted its tender price for "medium" level of competence.

The sum of prices for all three (3) tiers constitutes the total tender amount and it is evaluated.

The best and worst value of the total tender amount is given for the price per each sub-area. Best value finally gives 50 points as the criterion Price is worth 50% in the procurement.

IMPORTANT! A Supplier whose total bid amount is lower than "Best Value" will be awarded extra points, i.e. higher number of points than 50 points. However, in the event that the total bid amount is lower than the stated best value (or higher than the worst value), the number of points awarded will be 5 times less than in the case the total bid amount is within the best and worst value scale. This is a difference from how the general model works. In addition to the criterion Price for all sub-areas, this also applies to the criterion Margin Percentage, sub-area A-Consultant Broker.

Example (numbers in ex are rounded for simplicity and do not have to match the real scores in the model)

- Supplier 1 - the total tender amount is 3358 SEK (within the specified scale) is awarded 45 points
- Supplier 2 - the total bid amount is 3328 SEK (corresponds to the best value) is awarded 50 points
- Supplier 3 - the total bid amount is 3298 SEK (outside the best value) is awarded only 51 points, i.e. only 1 point extra even if the tender is 30 SEK cheaper than tender no. 2.
- Note that the difference in tenders between Supplier No. 2 and No. 1 was also SEK 30 and in this case the point difference was as much as 5 points (as the tender fits within the specified scale best and worst value)

##### Evaluation criterion References sub-areas B-J

All the referees' answers and points are summed up and divided by the number of answers, according to Appendix 2A. The result will be the score awarded to the Supplier and after adaptation to the evaluation model as set out below.

The response alternatives used in Appendix 2 A apply, where the maximum number of points is 10 and the minimum is equal to 0.

##### Example 1 - For references 50%

A Supplier is awarded the following points out of 3 referees: (10p + 8 p + 9p + 7p + 6p + 5p) = 45p/number of answers (6) = 7.5p = 75p. Since the References criterion is worth 50%, the final result is 37.5 points.

##### Subarea A - Consultant Broker

The same principles apply as above, with the difference that the sub-area has several evaluation criteria. These are stated in documents Subarea A - Consultant brokers.

### 2.5 Procurement conditions

2.5.1. Procurement procedure

The procurement is carried out through an open procedure.

<!-- image -->

As a Supplier, you are encouraged to carefully review and check your tender before it is submitted.

The following applies:

- In the Procurement Document, the Supplier is responsible for ensuring that the requested information is provided and the requested documents are attached to the tender. This is to demonstrate that the Supplier meets the prerequisites and mandatory requirements.
- If the Supplier refrains from responding to any of the mandatory requirements, this will be interpreted as meaning that the requirements cannot be met or accepted.
- By submitting a tender, the Supplier accepts all the terms and conditions of the Procurement Document and certifies that the information submitted in the tender is truthful.
- If necessary, the Supplier must be able to substantiate all the information provided in the tender.

The tender must be written in Swedish. However, certificates, certificates and certificates or similar may be in English or Scandinavian languages. No compensation is paid for the preparation of tenders.

Tenders must be submitted electronically via TendSign. The email address used by the Supplier to log in to TendSign is the one that applies to all communication regarding the procurement. The vendor's contact person is specified in TendSign.

The tender may not contain any alternative tenders.

In the event that a Supplier makes reservations or makes reservations against the terms of the Procurement Document, the tender may be rejected. Suppliers are asked to avoid providing information that has not been requested and that can be seen as a reservation against set requirements.

##### Validity of the tender

The supplier is bound by its tender six months after the closing date. In the event that the procurement is reviewed, the Supplier is bound by the tender up to and including two months after the time when the review has been concluded by a final judgment/decision.

<!-- image -->

Questions in connection with the procurement must be submitted in writing and as early as possible via TendSign. Only written answers in TendSign are binding. The supplier is responsible for keeping up to date on questions and answers.

Questions and answers as well as any clarifications, additions or amendments form part of the Procurement Documents. Procurement questions are only answered by the procurement manager.

Technical questions about the system should be directed to TendSign support by email ts@google.com. Manual, instructional video and frequently asked questions and answers can be found at TendSign support. TendSign support is open weekdays 07.00-17.00.

#### 2.5.4 Information on the processing of personal data

Since the Supplier submits personal data with its tender, Purchasing and Procurement has an obligation to inform about the processing that Purchasing and Procurement will carry out in its capacity as data controller.

The processing of personal data is necessary for the implementation of the procurement and if

Framework agreements are entered into, in order to be able to fulfil and follow up on the framework agreement and procurement. If a framework agreement is entered into, some of the personal data will be visible in the electronic ordering system Proceedo, which is open to everyone.

The personal data will be stored until the purpose of the processing has been fulfilled and will then be handled in accordance with the applicable legal rules. Personal data is generally public documents.

The persons whose personal data is processed have the right to:

- request access to their personal data;
- request rectification or erasure or restriction of processing of their personal data;
- object to the processing of their personal data;
- Request data portability
- complain about Purchasing and Procurement's processing of their personal data to the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY).

As there are special rules regarding the handling of public documents, some of these rights are limited. The Supplier is responsible for ensuring that the persons whose personal data is contained in the tender receive the above information.

The Purchasing and Procurement Data Protection Officer can be reached by phone 000-000 00 00.

#### 2.5.5 Award decision and signing of agreements

After the procurement has been completed, Purchasing and Procurement makes the award decision. Assignment decisions are sent to all Suppliers to the email address the Supplier registered in TendSign.

The award decision does not constitute a binding agreement. A legally binding agreement between Purchasing and Procurement and the winning Suppliers is concluded by signing a Framework Agreement by both Parties and enters into force only after the period of the blocking period has expired.

##### Electronic signing of framework agreements

Purchasing and procurement uses electronic signing (e-signing) of framework agreements. To be able to perform e-signing in the procurement tool TendSign, an e-ID or an e-service ID is required, as well as an account with ChamberSign. The account with ChamberSign is free of charge and registration is done on www.csign.se

The supplier states the name, e-mail address and telephone number of the person who is the signatory of a possible framework agreement below.

<!-- image -->

#### 2.5.6 Confidentiality

A Supplier who considers that information provided in the tender fulfils the conditions for commercial secrecy (Chapter 31, Section 16 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) on Business and Operating Conditions) must clearly state a request for confidentiality in its tender. Such a request must specify what information is referred to and what damage the Supplier would suffer if the information is disclosed. Any request for secrecy with clarifications and justification must be entered in the fields below.

A confidentiality assessment is always carried out in connection with a request for information, and Purchasing and Procurement cannot guarantee that a request for confidentiality will not result in the document being disclosed. A confidentiality decision may also be reviewed by a court.

## 3. Framework Agreement Terms

<!-- image -->

Orders from the Framework Agreement are made by the Client. The terms of the framework agreement also apply between

The Supplier and the Client. The Supplier undertakes to carry out Assignments and deliveries to the extent and on the terms set out in the Framework Agreement and in the Call-off Agreement after ordering.

<!-- image -->

The planned contract period of the framework agreement is 48 months. Purchasing and procurement has the option to terminate the framework agreement with a notice period of 6 months. However, the agreement runs for a minimum of 24 months. At the end of the planned agreement period, the Framework Agreement will expire without prior notice. If the Parties agree, a termination may be revoked in order to avoid a lack of contract.

In addition to termination in accordance with the paragraph above, which can be done without cause, termination is regulated by the Framework Agreement in the section "Early termination".

The framework agreement is valid from the time it is signed by both Parties, but at the earliest from the planned start of the agreement.

If the planned start of the agreement is postponed, the agreement period will start after the first Framework Agreement has been signed by both Parties. However, the Framework Agreement expires for all of them, without notice, on the date on which the term of the agreement expires for the first Framework Agreement.

<!-- image -->

The framework agreement documents complement each other. Should the framework agreement documents prove to be contradictory in any respect, they shall apply to each other, unless circumstances clearly require otherwise, in the following order:

- Written amendments and additions to the Framework Agreement which have been approved in writing by both Parties.
- Framework agreement.
- The procurement documents.
- Order/Assignment/Call-off Agreement.
- Supplier's tender.

The call-off agreement, specification or other instructions and documents and be executed at the agreed place. The assignment must be suitable for the Client's purpose with the order.

The client may not be refused the delivery of the services covered by the Framework Agreement unless there are special reasons. In times of high demand and extended delivery times, the Client on the Framework Agreement shall be the Supplier's highest priority.

The supplier must use competent and suitable staff for this purpose, where supervisors and key personnel must understand and speak Swedish. For consultants, the Swedish language usually applies. However, in the case of call-offs during the framework agreement period, consultants who speak other languages such as English or other Scandinavian languages may be accepted by the Client.

The Supplier is obliged to replace persons without unreasonable delay if the Client so requests and has objective reasons for its request, such as that the person lacks the necessary skills or that there are cooperation difficulties. The Supplier is not entitled to replace essential personnel for the Assignment without the Client's approval unless there are objective reasons.

- The hourly rate/cost of the assignment shall be decisive for the choice of the Supplier, provided that the offered consultant meets the requirements for the required competence role and level of knowledge (this shall be possible by requesting a CV for the winning tender).

##### Renewed tendering

For orders exceeding SEK 250,000, all framework agreement suppliers within the framework agreement area in question must be invited in writing to submit a new tender to see which supplier best meets the need at the time in question (renewed competitive tendering). Call-off responses must be submitted in writing. Framework agreement suppliers are obliged to provide a call-off response to each call-off request, even if the service cannot be offered and the reason for this must be stated in the tender response. In the case of renewed competitive tendering, one or more of the following evaluation criteria shall be used:

<!-- image -->

Where applicable, the order shall be defined in the Call-off Agreement. Call-offs on the Framework Agreement must take place within the Framework Agreement's contract period. The term of the call-off agreement is not dependent on the contract period of the Framework Agreement, but is regulated in the call-off agreement. Automatic extensions of call-off agreements are not accepted.

The Supplier shall send an order confirmation that reproduces the content of the Assignment.  Electronic order confirmations must be sent in one of the City of Gothenburg's approved formats.

<!-- image -->

The Client's approval of the completed Assignment does not relieve the Supplier of liability for such errors and deficiencies that could not be clearly discovered by the Client.

<!-- image -->

Electronic commerce is made possible between the Supplier and the City of Gothenburg with the standard solutions used by the City of Gothenburg. The electronic e-commerce system the City of Gothenburg has will be used in the first place, but other ordering methods may also occur. On goteborg.se/ehandel these are indicated.

Other Clients who use the same e-commerce system as the City of Gothenburg automatically inherit agreements and set up e-commerce solutions for orders and catalogues. Each Client is responsible for providing the necessary information for connection to e-commerce and e-invoices. Any costs that arise due to the implementation of necessary e-commerce solutions are the responsibility of the Supplier.

The above requirements regarding the set up for e-commerce apply to all participating Clients. If other solutions are requested, it is up to the Supplier to decide whether a deviating solution is possible. Each Client is responsible for incurred costs related to this.

All communication must take place via approved communication channels. The Network for Electronic Business, NEA, has developed "General Provisions for E-Communications Contracts" which are accepted when tenders are submitted. Information on these provisions can be found on goteborg.se/ehandel.

Forms - Before the start of the agreement, one or more electronic forms will be set up on the Framework Agreement by the City of Gothenburg. Keywords and information about the procured area are linked to the form. A link to the Supplier's website can be provided. Linked information shall be kept active by the Supplier throughout the contract period.

Renewed competitive tendering (FKU) - Manual for how to submit answers to FKU can be found at goteborg.se/proceedo. A special e-mail address for receipt of FKU is specified by the Supplier when signing the agreement. To this e-mail address, all FKU on the Framework Agreement made in Proceedo will be sent. The supplier is responsible for ensuring that the e-mail address provided is correct throughout the contract period so as not to miss out on participating in FKU. The supplier is also responsible for ensuring that the sending email address is approved by the recipient. Autoresponders from the Provider are not handled.

Orders - Electronic orders will be sent as e-mail with orders as attachments. Orders may contain additional attachments for further specification of the order. All orders must be handled. A specific email address for receiving orders must be provided. All orders for the Framework Agreement made in Proceedo will be sent to this email address. An electronic order confirmation shall be sent to the Client in response to an e-mail received with the attached order. Please note that orders can be sent from organizations that inherit the Framework Agreement.

<!-- image -->

The Client and the Supplier shall jointly agree on a binding timetable and/or time for the start and completion of the Assignment. If this has not been done, the Supplier shall, at the Client's request, draw up a proposal for a timetable. If the time is extended or the assignment is changed, the timetable must be adjusted.

The Supplier shall continuously and at the times determined by the Client submit reports on the results that emerge. Reporting shall be done in accordance with the Client's instructions.

The assignment shall be considered completed when the result has been reported and submitted in the form agreed between the Client and the Supplier and approved in writing by the Client.

<!-- image -->

The Supplier shall without delay notify the Client in writing if it is probable that an agreed delivery time cannot be met, stating the reasons for the delay and the time when delivery can take place. If the Supplier does not deliver the resource/assignment in accordance with the Framework Agreement or what the Client and Supplier have agreed and this is not due to the Client or any circumstances on the Client's side, there is a delay. A delay in the delivery is equated with a delay in installing the Assignment when installation is included.

In the event of a delay, the Supplier shall pay a penalty of 5 per cent of the delayed part of the order, per each week commenced. This is regardless of whether parts of the Assignment have been completed on time. However, the total amount of the penalty for the delay shall not exceed 15 per cent of the delayed part of the order.

The client has the right to demand fulfillment. If the delay is significant, the Client has the right to cancel the order regarding the delayed part of the delivery. Significant delay means, but is not limited to:

- such a delay that entitles the Client to a maximum penalty compensation
- a delay that results in the purpose of the delivery being missed, and/or
- non-delivery. The Client also has the right to cancel the order if there is reason to believe that future deliveries will not be completed without significant delay.

Regardless of whether cancellation takes place, the Client is entitled to compensation for the direct damage caused by the delay. What has been paid in penalty must then be deducted.

The client has the right to withhold as much of the payment as can correspond to the claim due to the delay.

The Supplier is entitled to compensation for shown additional costs that have arisen due to delays caused by the Client that the Supplier should not have foreseen when placing the order.

<!-- image -->

The assignment shall be considered to have been performed incorrectly if the result deviates from what the Supplier has promised or marketed and what the Client could reasonably have assumed based on the conditions at the time the order was created and other things that have been agreed.

<!-- image -->

If the Client wishes to claim that the Assignment has been performed incorrectly, the Client shall notify the Supplier within a reasonable time from the time the error has been established.

In the event of a defect, the Client has the right, at its own discretion, to demand rectification or a price reduction corresponding to the defect. Rectification shall be made at no cost to the Client. If a request for rectification has been made and rectification is not made within a reasonable time, the Client has the right to have another person correct the defect at the Supplier's expense.

If the error is of material importance to the Client, the Client has the right to cancel the Assignment. The Client also has the right to cancel the remaining part of the Assignment if there are strong reasons to assume that the Assignment will not be completed without material errors.

Regardless of whether cancellation takes place, the Client is entitled to compensation for the direct damage caused by the defect.

<!-- image -->

The Supplier is responsible for any damage to persons or property caused by the Product, when the Goods are included in the service.

If a claim arises against the Client due to the harmful property of the Product, the

The Supplier shall assist in investigating where the damage lies and indemnify the Client if the damage is likely to be due to a circumstance of the Product. The Supplier's liability remains as long as such claims can be directed against the Client.

<!-- image -->

Fees that have not been agreed in writing will not be accepted regardless of the designation. Possible congestion tax

or similar taxes and fees for the performance of Assignments under this Framework Agreement are paid by the Supplier.

<!-- image -->

Framework agreement prices refer to ceiling prices in SEK per hour and per sub-area, excluding VAT and including all other costs. The hourly rate specified in the tender shall refer to the most advanced role for the sub-area in question. The hourly rate submitted in the tender for the most advanced role shall also be the hourly rate for any roles in the sub-area that are not specified in the procurement/framework agreement.

In the case of call-offs within the sub-area, lower hourly rates may and should be offered as most call-offs do not relate to the most advanced role.

Stated ceiling prices per sub-area are fixed for one year after the planned start of the agreement. The compensation regulates all costs associated with the assignment. The parties are then entitled to an annual price adjustment. Price adjustments shall be made annually thereafter according to Statistics Sweden's Producer Price Index for Services (TPI, 62 computer programming, computer consulting services, etc.). Price adjustment shall apply to all Suppliers.

The base date will be 2022 Q2. The settlement date for the index adjustment shall be 2023, Q3, etc. No retroactive price changes or price changes for ongoing assignments are allowed. The request for adjustment, including documentation of a change in the index for the requested price adjustment, must be received by Purchasing and Procurement no later than 4 weeks before any adjustment.

If an agreement is not reached, both parties have the right to terminate the current agreement in writing, observing the notice period of 6 months. During the notice period, the old framework agreement terms apply.

##### Exception

A higher price than the ceiling price (maximum permitted price level 5) may only apply in call-offs relating to:

"exception competence", competence level 6, as stated is given the competence level, i.e. must always be approved by the Client. Call-offs of expert competence and approval of these should be preceded by call-offs at competence level 5. It is only then if no consultants with sufficient quality/knowledge level 5 cannot be offered by Suppliers that call-offs of "exceptional competence" shall take place where a higher price than the framework agreement price is allowed. This may take place in one and the same FKU.

##### Call-off of assignments

When calling off a project assignment, the Supplier must offer a fixed price that relates to the assignment in its entirety. For assignments where minor supplements may be necessary, an hourly rate may be requested as a supplement to the fixed price. In the event that the planned time required for the assignment is significantly exceeded/undercut, the parties must be able to agree in advance on the use of e.g. the following model:

• to the extent that the scope of the assignment is exceeded or is below a certain percentage of the scope of the assignment, the Client shall be charged only for half of the applicable/agreed hourly rate. The same hourly rate or fixed price shall apply regardless of whether the consultancy service is performed at the authority's location or at the Supplier.

##### Permitted deviations from ceiling prices

All sub-areas - for call-offs where a higher price than the maximum permitted prices at level 5 are applied and where the competence could not be obtained in any other way apply - Actual travel expenses. A maximum of 40% of the hourly rate is applied for travel time. These must be approved in writing by the Client and the Supplier must report these call-offs to Purchasing and Procurement. Please note that this shall only apply in exceptional cases.

All these call-offs must be able to be reported to Purchasing and Procurement on request.

In the event that the agreed index should be discontinued (stop being launched) during the contract period, Purchasing and Procurement will, in consultation with the relevant issuer, produce a new applicable index and a possibly updated comparison month for price adjustment on the Framework Agreement.

Web development is a collective term for everything around the construction of a website. This includes server/client-side programming, web design, system development, data security, database building, etc.

<!-- image -->

An art director (in English: advertising designer) helps lead a creative process and controls the visual parts of what is created. An art director is visually and communicatively responsible and leads or collaborates with web designers, illustrators and programmers. An art director stands for the aesthetic creativity and the role is sometimes synonymous with graphic designer, but in other contexts denotes a person who primarily leads other graphic designers.

<!-- image -->

Web developers transfer the designer's sketches and ideas into HTML code, stylesheets, server-side applications, javascript code, and other files. This can be done with tools such as web editors, or directly in the content management system that the website uses. The work is often referred to as the implementation of the design or simply as the development of the design.

The role means, among other things, that it must be possible to propose technical solutions and implement user interfaces in web applications based on requirements. Work on developing suggestions for updates of style guides, templates and checklists as well as developing graphic components may occur. The role also means that you must be able to act as a mentor to the staff and create guides and other materials that can help raise the level of competence of the staff.

Knowledge of some tools/environments:

- Web functionality/architecture, servers, browsers
- Web Standards
- Java, HTML or equivalent
- CGI, EJB, PERL, VB Script, XML, XLS or equivalent
- Episerver, Sitevision, Application Center or similar platforms.

<!-- image -->

Graphic designers are responsible for the graphic design of a printed matter, packaging or website on the Internet, i.e. give the product a shape by choosing letters, symbols, images and colours. The goal is often that the appearance of the product should reflect some of the content and also be easy to understand. Is sometimes synonymous with art director, but in some contexts is subordinate to one.

<!-- image -->

A high level of accessibility adaptation in the development of web and e-services is a requirement. When designing, the applicable W3C, WCAG standard. Within Interaction Design Web, the consultants work with development from classic information websites to more advanced e-services with a focus on communication and usability. The supplier must be able to provide complete solutions, from user testing and interaction design to prototypes and design of simple web campaigns in HTML or in Adobe Flash to more comprehensive overall concepts. Experience of major portal implementations.

<!-- image -->

The frontend is what we see in our browsers, that is, the interface with which we interact when visiting different websites. The frontend prescribes how functions and information should be presented, as well as how the website should function in general. The frontend developer works with customer-driven development as websites and browsers become increasingly advanced, which places demands on specific skills.

In addition to CSS and jQuery, solid programming skills are needed as browsers begin to be used as a serious programming platform. A good understanding of design and user-friendliness is also valuable.

<!-- image -->

A knowledge manager is responsible for ensuring that the team or project they are working on uses knowledge management as they should. The role ensures that the expected processes around knowledge management happen at the right time and they also ensure that the expected technology is applied.

The role ensures that the project staff get the knowledge they need, that this knowledge is applied to the project work, and that new knowledge is taken care of and shared. A knowledge manager monitors the processes of learning before, during, and after work and uses coaching to make sure these processes happen.

<!-- image -->

A technical writer helps to write, structure and analyze information for different types of communication channels, e.g. for websites or written materials. The technical writer can also help with producing different types of technical descriptions in IT such as user and system documentation. The role can also be more focused on information design and making information understandable and easily accessible, or work with combinations of text and images. The role may also involve responsibility for the information and communication process in the organization or project.
