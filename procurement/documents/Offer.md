## **AUA.121 Contractor's representative during the tender period**

Administration for Purchasing and Procurement, 212000-1355

Box 1111

405 23 Göteborg

Purchasing and procurement is an administration of the City of Gothenburg and is the city's purchasing centre. Purchasing and procurement, such as the central purchasing centre, are included in framework agreements in its own name. Purchasing and procurement can also, in

As a central purchasing body, enter into agreements on procurement cooperation with municipalities, municipal associations and other procuring authorities/entities within the Gothenburg region.

## **AUA.2 Information about the site	![][image16]AUA.21 Overview of the site	![][image17]**

Gothenburg is facing its biggest leap in development in modern times. The city will grow by almost a third by 2035 and make room for 150,000 new Gothenburgians, 80,000 new homes and new jobs. The goal is a sustainable and close city and with that comes major infrastructure projects for traffic solutions and extensive housing and premises supply programs. All within the framework of a green strategy. With the rapid growth and intensive community building, there is a great need for a wide range of technical consultants with a high level of expertise. Both for shorter and longer assignments as well as assignments with a short cancellation time.


This agreement covers the agreement category Management and Governance. The category includes consulting services regarding overall operational issues related to management and governance in the sustainability area of the environment with the adjacent area of social responsibility.


The framework agreement is an agreement without volume obligations. Activities that concern the framework agreement area can be conducted under our own management. In such cases, the framework agreement is to be regarded as a complement to the company's own activities. Please note that there may already be agreements in force for activities that concern the area of the framework agreement. These agreements do not expire by virtue of this Framework Agreement.


A general information about the objects for the assignment is provided when ordering.

## **Agreement type**

The procurement will be concluded by Purchasing and Procurement and the accepted consultants signing a framework agreement. The intention is that framework agreements will be signed with several consultants.

The number of consultants who will sign framework agreements depends on the number of tenders received and that the accepted consultants have a capacity that meets the needs of the contract users.

## **AUA.3 Information about the project and the assignment	![][image15]AUA.32 Estimated volume of the framework agreement	![][image14]**

**Estimated business value**

The order volume during the total contract period is estimated at SEK 30,000,000. The specified volume represents the business value of the Framework Agreement. This is only an estimate based on the turnover of previous Framework Agreements, expected quantities for the Clients and what has emerged in the analysis prior to the procurement. The actual outcome can be both higher (but maximum the ceiling volume of the procurement) and lower, and no guaranteed volumes are provided. The estimated business value may, for example, decrease as a result of the Client notifying deviations from the Framework Agreement in accordance with the City of Gothenburg's guideline for purchasing and procurement.

**Ceiling volume**

The total order volume during the total contract period may amount to a maximum of SEK 60,000,000. The specified volume constitutes the ceiling volume of the Framework Agreement.

In the event of a change in operations/organisation, changed legislation, political decisions, official decisions or the like that affect the need, volumes, number of Clients or delivery points, Purchasing and Procurement reserves the right to adjust the above-mentioned ceiling volume for the Framework Agreement in accordance with the conditions set out below.

If the Framework Agreement's turnover reaches the specified ceiling volume or this situation is expected to occur in the near future, Purchasing and Procurement has the right to terminate the Framework Agreement with immediate effect. Such termination shall not affect the validity of contracts concluded on the basis of the Framework Agreement prior to that date.

**Amendment option ceiling volume**

If the accumulated value of call-offs made from the Framework Agreement during the first 24 months of the agreement period exceeds more than 60 per cent of the value of the specified ceiling volume, Purchasing and Procurement is entitled to increase the specified ceiling volume by 20 per cent. In this respect, value refers to the amounts in SEK that constitute the total call-offs from the ceiling volume of the Framework Agreement.

The change option can be exercised during the entire planned contract period. In the event that Purchasing and Procurement exercises the option, written notice shall be sent to the Supplier.

**AUA.33 Start of agreement**	![][image16]

Planned end of the contract 2026-05-31.

## **AUA.35 Contract period	![][image17]**

The planned contract period of the framework agreement is 48 months. Purchasing and procurement has the option to terminate the framework agreement with a notice period of 3 months. However, the agreement runs for a minimum of 24 months. At the end of the planned agreement period, the framework agreement will expire without prior notice.


In addition to termination in accordance with the paragraph above, which can be made without cause, termination is regulated by the framework agreement in the section "Early termination".


The framework agreement applies from the time it has been signed by both parties, but at the earliest from the planned start of the agreement.


If the planned start of the agreement is postponed, the agreement period starts after the first framework agreement has been signed by both parties.


However, the framework agreement ceases to apply to all of them, without notice, on the date on which the first framework agreement expires in the period of the agreement.

**Agreement users** – The municipalities, administrations, municipal associations and companies, etc., that have the right to use the framework agreement.

JS CEO, ACME G Inc (LBS AB)

- The company had previously hired another consultant for the assignment, but during the external preliminary audit, serious deficiencies were revealed, whereby our Consultant was contacted (and the first consultant's engagement was terminated). The first step was therefore that the Consultant, from existing material, sorted out what was useful, what should be discarded and what was missing.  \- A project group was formed (CEO, KMA manager and the Consultant) and the Consultant developed a schedule and work methodology for the work, which partly needed to be project managed remotely for the greatest efficiency and because the pandemic broke out. The management system needed to be put in place quickly because the external audit had begun and the company otherwise risked extra costs and delays in the necessary certificates.

- A repository for versioned documentation via an external cloud service was secured.  \- Via telephone and physical meetings, the ongoing project work was carried out through weekly meetings with reconciliations and review of new tasks. The work was prepared by the Consultant through templates and "best practice", and the company completed its material based on this documentation, which was then quality reviewed by the Consultant. The work included, for example:

* process mapping based on the company's vision/strategy

* stakeholder analysis and risk/opportunity assessment of aspects/requirements/hazards

* Preparation of a compliant list of statutes and other binding requirements

* Development of resourced operational goals with action plans

* relevant key figures, documented procedures and deviation management

* List of chemicals for environmentally safe management and risk assessment

* Training of safety representatives for carrying out safety rounds

* Communication/training of employees

- Once the system was in place, internal audits and Management's review were carried out for evaluation and to ensure the system's implementation.

- The consultant participated in the three-day external audit, which resulted in the company receiving the three desired certificates with a successful pass.

- Since the end of the project, the Consultant has continued to work for the company with the continuous improvement work around the management system.


Requirements for specialist competence:

- Many years of experience in building and implementing integrated management systems in widely different industries and an enthusiastic and constructive approach to the problem result in efficient work.

- Expertise in quickly identifying the customer's special conditions enables adaptation to the customer's needs

- Skills in quickly and efficiently transferring expertise and leading a time-pressed project to stay on schedule and ensure anchoring.

A consultant, who does not have the capacity to submit tenders himself, has the possibility of using other undertakings as an external capacity to meet the requirements of economic, financial standing and/or technical and professional capacity.

The information contained in these free texts and appendices constitutes, according to X Swedish Consulting,

Group AB's opinion, trade secrets according to the Act (1990:409) on the Protection of Trade Secrets. The Supreme Administrative Court's decision in case 5865-15 states that information in tenders regarding methods, processes, technical capabilities, capacity, reference assignments, and tendered consultants normally constitutes trade secrets. The content of the documents that X ACME H Inc AB wishes to be confidential relates to such information. Disclosure of those documents would thus mean that competitors would have access to X ACME H Inc AB's trade secrets, which would lead to a significant competitive disadvantage for X ACME H Inc AB as well as financial damage.

Purchasing and procurement uses electronic signing (e-signing) of framework agreements.

To be able to perform e-signing in the procurement tool TendSign, an e-ID or an e-service ID is required, as well as an account with ChamberSign.

E-identification (linked to a person) can be ordered free of charge via your internet bank, either as BankiD on card or as Mobile BankiD. The latter does not require a card reader or installations on the computer. More information can be found on your internet bank or on www.e-legitimation.se.

E-service identification (linked to organisation) is issued by Steria (https://eid.steria.se/). Keep in mind that it can take up to seven business days to obtain an e-service certificate. Contact ChamberSign if you already have an e-service certificate that you want to use.

The account with ChamberSign is free of charge and you register on www.csign.se. Remember to have your e-ID or e-service certificate at hand during registration. If you are a signatory, you will be registered immediately and can start signing immediately. If you are not a signatory, you may need to send a power of attorney to ChamberSign. In most cases, powers of attorney are registered within one working day.

The consultant states the name, e-mail address and telephone number of the person who is the signatory of a possible framework agreement below.

In relation to other public sector employees, the Code provides for a special restriction. Invitations to seminars or similar must have a clear benefit in the service for the participant and be sent to the employer, who approves participation and appoints the persons to participate.

## **Social consideration**

The City of Gothenburg reserves the right to conduct a dialogue with future contract suppliers throughout the contract period about the possibility of creating work for people who need the municipality's help to get a job. The aim is to enable people to become self-sufficient.


The City of Gothenburg's desire is for the contracting entities and the city's contract suppliers to use the model for social considerations. The dialogue is conducted through the support function for social considerations in procurement.

as the breach of contract lasts. The penalty payment shall be paid for a maximum of 10 weeks.

If the breach of contract is not of a permanent nature, a fine of SEK 10,000 is payable on each individual occasion.


Any payment of periodic penalty payments under the framework agreement or the call-off agreement does not relieve the supplier from remedying the defect complained of.

The above does not apply to a provision with a specially regulated penalty.

However, the client or Purchasing and Procurement is entitled to claim damages corresponding to the actual damage in lieu of a fine as described above.

## **5.12 Liability for damages**

If the client, supplier or Purchasing and Procurement violates the provisions of the framework agreement and correction is not made immediately after the request to this effect has been sent, the party shall pay damages to the other party.

Damages between the parties are limited to direct loss, but not more than an amount per injury corresponding to 25 times the price base amount that applies at any given time under the Social Insurance Code. The restriction does not apply if intent or gross negligence exists.

If Purchasing and Procurement or the client is entitled to a fine from the supplier, this does not limit the right to receive damages for the costs caused by the breach of contract. However, the penalty payment must be deducted from the damages.

## **5.13 Product liability**

If the product is included in the service, the consultant is responsible for all damage to person or property caused by the product.

If a claim arises against the client due to the harmful property of the product, the consultant must help to investigate where the damage lies and indemnify the client if the damage is likely to be due to a condition of the product. The consultant's liability remains as long as such claims can be directed against the client.

## **5.14 Grounds for Release (Force Majeure)**

The contractor, consultant or Purchasing and Procurement shall be released from its obligations under the framework agreement if the performance thereof is prevented by circumstances beyond its control which it could not reasonably have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the framework agreement and the consequences of which could not reasonably have been avoided or overcome. Examples of such circumstances are war, terrorist acts, natural disasters, fires, government action and labour disputes.

A person who intends to invoke the above described circumstance must immediately notify the opposing party in writing thereof. Purchasing and procurement and the consultant will work to find alternative solutions so that the framework agreement can be fulfilled despite the above obstacles.

As soon as the alleged circumstance has ceased, the opposing party shall be informed thereof. If the performance of the framework agreement is substantially prevented for a period longer than ninety (90) calendar days due to certain circumstances stated above, the party may, without any obligation to pay compensation, withdraw from the framework agreement in writing.

## **5.15 Commission**

**Amount of commission**

Purchasing and procurement finance the central purchasing body through commission income from sales under the framework agreements provided. The size of the commission is set by the City Council and is based on the costs incurred by Purchasing and Procurement to operate the purchasing centre.

Currently, the commission is set at 1.2 percent of the turnover reported by the supplier under this framework agreement.

Purchasing and procurement has the right to adjust the percentage size of the commission during the contract period after the municipal council's decision to either increase or decrease the commission. The margin for adjustment under this agreement is between 0.5 and 2.0 percent.


Such change shall be notified to the Supplier at least 30 days in advance and may take effect in connection with any of the quarterly periods set out below.

If Purchasing and Procurement exercises its right to change the amount of the commission, the supplier's price will be adjusted to the same extent as the change and from the same date this takes effect.

Price adjustments made in accordance with this clause do not affect the possibility of price adjustment under the "Price and Price Adjustment" section.

**Accounting and payment of commission**

The supplier itself reports the turnover of the framework agreement to Purchasing and Procurement. Sales shall include all deliveries and assignments under the framework agreement, excluding VAT.

The turnover is reported on the website with the address: http://avtalsredovisning.goteborg.se. Login is required: The supplier's contact person and password for accounting are obtained by email from the Purchasing and Procurement Finance Department.

The reporting is done quarterly and shall be done as follows:

* Quarter 1 (1 Jan – 31 March) – received by Purchasing and Procurement as soon as possible, but no later than week 18

* Q2 (1 Apr – 30 June) – received by Purchasing and Procurement as soon as possible, but no later than week 33

* Q3 (1 Jul – 30 Sep) – Purchasing and procurement will be received as soon as possible, but no later than week 44

* Q4 (1 Oct – 31 Dec) – received Purchasing and procurement as soon as possible, but no later than week 4

The supplier is responsible for reporting sales per unit ordered under the framework agreement. If the supplier has no turnover to report, the supplier must report "0". If the supplier has several framework agreements with Purchasing and Procurement, the supplier must report on all framework agreements separately.

Purchasing and procurement invoices the supplier on a quarterly commission in accordance with the supplier's reported turnover. Payment terms are 30 days net.

**Penalty for failure to report turnover under the framework agreement**

Purchasing and procurement are entitled to a fine if the supplier fails to fulfil its obligations regarding the reporting of turnover. A fine is payable if the supplier has not rectified accounting deficiencies within 10 days after a written reminder. A fine of SEK 3,000 is then paid for each week that has begun. The maximum penalty amount is SEK 15,000 for each accounting period/framework agreement.

Purchasing and Procurement has the right to check that the supplier has fulfilled its obligations regarding the accounting of turnover by hiring an authorized auditor appointed by Purchasing and Procurement.

The auditor shall be given access to invoices and accounting records relating to what is required for the control and is not in conflict with the law or stock exchange rules applicable to the supplier.

If the inspection shows that the supplier has reported correctly, Purchasing and Procurement will be responsible for the audit cost. Should the control show that there are deficiencies in the accounting, the supplier must bear the cost, however, a maximum of an amount per occasion corresponding to half the price base amount according to the Social Insurance Code.

## **5.16. Provision of documents and information in connection with the 	Cessation**

Upon termination of the framework agreement, the consultant is obligated to assist Purchasing and Procurement free of charge with the necessary information or material for any new consultant and/or Purchasing and Procurement.

## **5.17 Sub-consultant as external capacity**

After tenders have been submitted, the consultant may not engage or change sub-consultant identified as external capacity to meet economic, financial standing and/or technical and professional capacity requirements without the written consent of Purchasing and Procurement. In the event of a change or use of such a subcontractor, the request must be received by Purchasing and Procurement no later than four weeks before the planned change or hire, unless there are special reasons.


The consultant is responsible for ensuring that the sub-consultants referred to meet the requirements for economic and financial standing and/or technical and professional capacity and is responsible for the sub-consultant who, for his or her part, both in terms of personnel and work. The consultant is responsible for checking that subcontractors meet the applicable requirements of the framework agreement and shall, upon Purchasing and Procurement's request, provide documentation for the existence of procedures for controls and the checks that have been carried out. Subcontractors may not engage their own subcontractors.


If it transpires that a sub-consultant does not meet the prescribed requirements, correction must be made promptly from the time Purchasing and Procurement has notified the consultant in writing of the error. If correction is not made within the prescribed time, Purchasing and Procurement has the right to demand that the sub-consultant is replaced immediately and not engaged by the consultant to meet requirements for economic and financial standing and/or technical and professional capacity. The consultant is obliged to ensure the corresponding capacity of the new sub-consultant.

## **5.18 Transfer of framework agreements**

Purchasing and Procurement may transfer this framework agreement, including all rights and obligations under the framework agreement, to another legal entity if it is to perform the tasks currently incumbent on Purchasing and Procurement.

A framework agreement entered into may be transferred under the conditions set out in Chapter 17\. 13 § LOU. The transfer must be approved in advance by Purchasing and Procurement and the transfer agreement must be drawn up in writing and signed by Purchasing and Procurement and the new consultant.

The Consultant is not entitled, without written consent, to assign, assign or pledge its rights or obligations under the Framework Agreement.

## **5.19 Changes in ownership**

If the shares in the consultant are transferred in their entirety, this change must be notified in writing to Purchasing and Procurement for approval.

In the case of unlisted companies, Purchasing and Procurement has the right to request extracts from the share register in order to verify the ownership structure.

## **5.20 Early termination**

Purchasing and Procurement and the supplier respectively have the right to terminate the framework agreement with immediate effect if the other party has committed a material breach of contract and rectification has not been made within a reasonable time, or has committed a breach of contract repeatedly.

The client has the right to terminate contracts entered into on the basis of the framework agreement if the supplier has committed a material breach of contract.

Purchasing and procurement has a unilateral right to terminate the framework agreement as set out below. Before the framework agreement is terminated due to circumstances relating to the supplier, the supplier shall, if possible, be given the opportunity to make corrections within 30 days. The following circumstances entitle Purchasing and Procurement to terminate the framework agreement with immediate effect:

* If the framework agreement has been subject to an amendment that is not permitted under Chapter 17\. Sections 9-14 of the Public Procurement Act, or

* If, at the time of the decision to award the contract or to conclude the framework agreement, the supplier was

in any of the situations referred to in Chapter 13\. 1 of the Public Procurement Act and should therefore have been excluded from the procurement, or

* If the Court of Justice finds in a ruling that the conclusion of the Framework Agreement constitutes a serious breach of EU law, or

* If the turnover of the framework agreement reaches the specified ceiling volume or this situation is expected to occur in the near future, or

* If the supplier is burdened for such grounds as follows from Chapter 13\. 1 – 3 §§ LOU even if the basis arose after the framework agreement was signed, or

* If the supplier does not maintain a mandatory requirement or a specific contractual term during the contract period, or

* If the supplier materially fails to fulfil its obligations under the framework agreement or in commitments set out in other documents or agreements that form part of the framework agreement between the parties, or

* If it appears that the supplier has provided incorrect information, including manipulation of documents, in the tender which, if correctly provided, would have meant that a framework agreement was not obtained, or

* If the supplier or its representatives violate relevant applicable legislation and this can be assumed to affect the performance of the framework agreement, confidence in the framework agreement in question or damage the reputation of Purchasing and Procurement and the client with the public, or

* If the supplier repeatedly does not report the correct basis for commission (total invoiced volume) or on at least two occasions reports a basis with a found amount to be too low, or

* If the supplier on at least two occasions has found that an assignment has been overcharged to the client, or

* If a court or supervisory authority determines that the framework agreement has been entered into in violation of procurement legislation, or

* If other irregularities of a serious nature on the part of the supplier have occurred.

During the time it takes to investigate the suspicions against the supplier as described above, Purchasing and Procurement has the right to temporarily remove the availability (so-called temporary order freeze) of the supplier's framework agreement in the contract database. The disputed circumstance that led to the order freeze does not require that a dispute has been finally settled. Throughout the time the disputed issue is subject to investigation and consideration, Purchasing and Procurement thus has the opportunity to use a temporary order freeze. The Supplier is not entitled to compensation for loss of revenue or other costs due to a temporary suspension of orders. In the event of early termination, the supplier is entitled to reasonable remuneration for the services provided by the supplier up to the date of termination of the framework agreement, but no right to receive any other compensation due to the termination of the framework agreement.

## **5.21 Dispute**

Disputes concerning the application or interpretation of this Framework Agreement and related legal relationships shall primarily be settled by negotiation between the parties. If the parties cannot agree, the dispute must be settled in the Gothenburg District Court in accordance with Swedish law. The fact that a dispute is referred to the court does not entitle the consultant to terminate the assignment.

## **5.22 Electronic signature**

The framework agreement has been signed by the parties through electronic signatures.

Yes

# **6\. European Single Procurement Document (ESPD)**

## **Information**

The supplier has the possibility, but no obligation, to submit a currently completed document "European Single Procurement Document (ESPD)" as preliminary proof that exclusion grounds do not exist and that the qualification requirements (for the supplier) are met.

**The document in question is thus completely voluntary for the supplier and does not need to be filled in if all questions in the procurement document have been answered\!**

If the supplier chooses to use the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) for itself and the capacity of other companies is invoked, in accordance with the procurement document's "Claimed capacity", a completed ESPD for each such company must also be submitted. In order for the supplier to be able to technically submit an ESPD for such a company, the supplier must register the company in question under TendSign's process step "Subcontractors" and select the option "Invoke capacity" for the company when registering. In the event that the supplier does not use the ESPD for its own part and/or no other company's capacity is invoked, the supplier can completely ignore TendSign's process step "Subcontractors".

Submitted ESPDs will be exposed in Proceedo in the event that the supplier receives a framework agreement.
