  - context: |
      ##### The evaluation criterion Price sub-area A and B-J

      All prices must be given without decimals. Prices that are calculated up and down for other competence levels are also rounded
      without decimals. However, the number of points awarded for a certain tender amount can be to two decimal places.

      The supplier shall in Appendix 1 Prices, for each sub-area (A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J) only state the price per hour for
      competence level 4 and for sub-area G - Technical support and Service Desk, the price per hour for competence level 3 shall be stated.

      Based on the submitted tender price, the price for higher and lower level of competence is calculated as described in documents
      for each sub-area (Higher and lower level prices are also stated in "Appendix 1 Prices" after the Supplier has submitted its tender
      price for "medium" level of competence.

      The sum of prices for all three (3) tiers constitutes the total tender amount and it is evaluated.

      The best and worst value of the total tender amount is given for the price per each sub-area. Best value finally gives 50 points
      as the criterion Price is worth 50% in the procurement.

      IMPORTANT! A Supplier whose total bid amount is lower than "Best Value" will be awarded extra points, i.e. higher number of points
      than 50 points. However, in the event that the total bid amount is lower than the stated best value (or higher than the worst value),
      the number of points awarded will be 5 times less than in the case the total bid amount is within the best and worst value scale.
      This is a difference from how the general model works. In addition to the criterion Price for all sub-areas, this also applies to the
      criterion Margin Percentage, sub-area A-Consultant Broker.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How should the supplier state the price for each sub-area?
        answer: |
          The supplier should state the price per hour for sub-areas A-J for competence level 4, and for sub-area G state the price per hour
          for competence level 3.
      - question: |
          How is the total tender amount calculated?
        answer: |
          The total tender amount is calculated as the sum of prices for all three competence level tiers.
      - question: |
          How is the total tender amount evaluated?
        answer: |
          After calculating the total tender amount, that total is evaluated by compariing it against the best and worst values
          for each sub-area. Points are awarded based on whether the total tender amount is within the best and worst value
          range for each sub-area.

      Purchasing and procurement are entitled to a fine if the Supplier fails to fulfil its obligations regarding the reporting of turnover.

      is then paid for each week that has begun. The maximum penalty amount is SEK 15,000 for each accounting period/framework agreement.
      Purchasing and Procurement has the right to check that the Supplier has fulfilled its obligations regarding the accounting of turnover
      by engaging an authorized auditor appointed by Purchasing and Procurement. The auditor shall be given access to invoices and accounting
      records relating to what is required for the control and is not in conflict with law or stock exchange rules applicable to the Supplier.
      If the control shows that the Supplier has reported correctly, Purchasing and Procurement will be responsible for the audit cost.

      amount per occasion corresponding to half the price base amount according to the Social Insurance Code.

      ### 5.2. Criteria for awarding contracts (evaluation criteria)
      Tender prices are ceiling prices for the most advanced consultant role in the sub-area and within each competence level 3-5
      as described in the procurement document. In the case of call-offs during the framework agreement period, these tender prices or
      lower tender prices must be applicable.
      In its tender, the supplier must specify the maximum price competence level 4 for the most advanced consultant role in the sub-area.

      Based on the submitted maximum bid price at competence level 4, the Supplier's maximum price for the other levels is determined as follows:
      - Competency level 5: Bid price for competency level 4 plus (+) 40% of that price.
      - Competency level 3: Bid price for competency level 4 minus (-) 29% of that price.

      NB! In the case of call-offs during the framework agreement period where a higher price than the maximum price for competence level 5
      has been quoted, the requirements apply:

      - The right price (level 6) must be approved in writing by the Client
      - Every six months, the supplier must report statistics on call-offs where these prices (level 6) have been applied.

      References must be stated in accordance with Appendix 2A References Consulting competence. References shall be provided for the
      consultant roles and skill levels set out in the Annex.

      Two references refer to resources and one refers to project assignments.

      The Supplier shall send the completed attachment with the tender only the information that is to be answered by the Supplier.
      Consultants to whom references refer must be included in the tender when submitting the tender, i.e. be employed by the Supplier
      or a contracted subcontractor.

      During the evaluation process, Purchasing and Procurement will email, by the supplier completed the appendix, to the specified referees
      with a request that these be answered within the specified time. Answers are only accepted by email and attached to a completed attachment.

      The final grade is the average score of all responses from referees. In case of no answer, 0 points are obtained.

          If there is a call-off during a framework agreement period and a higher price than the maximum price for competence level 5

          and Procurement with a request that these emails be answered within a specified time.
      - question: |
          How is the final grade for the references calculated?
        answer: |
